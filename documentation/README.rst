# Dork

Dork is a text based exploration game full of mystery, intrigue, but most importantly memes!  
The player finds him/herself in an exciting randomly generated maze where they can interact with rooms, items, *** Wait maybe not*** and non-player characters. 
Using cardinal directions and simple commands, the player navigates throughout the maze to find him/herself at the end of the road. 
Be careful not to stumble upon Trolly McTrollFace...
